      pdName is unique name of the PD resource in GCE. Used to identify the disk in GCE.

      fsType is filesystem type of the volume that you want to mount.
      Tip: Ensure that the filesystem type is supported by the host operating system.
      Examples: "ext4", "xfs", "ntfs". Implicitly inferred to be "ext4" if unspecified.

      partition is the partition in the volume that you want to mount.
      If omitted, the default is to mount by volume name.
      Examples: For volume /dev/sda1, you specify the partition as "1".
      Similarly, the volume partition for /dev/sda is "0" (or you can leave the property empty).

  Represents a Persistent Disk resource in Google Compute Engine.

  A GCE PD must exist before mounting to a container. The disk must
  also be in the same GCE project and zone as the kubelet. A GCE PD
  can only be mounted as read/write once or read-only many times. GCE
  PDs support ownership management and SELinux relabeling.
