      If true, AND if the owner has the "foregroundDeletion" finalizer, then
      the owner cannot be deleted from the key-value store until this
      reference is removed.
      See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/garbage-collection/#foreground-deletion
      for how the garbage collector interacts with this field and enforces the foreground deletion.
      Defaults to false.
      To set this field, a user needs "delete" permission of the owner,
      otherwise 422 (Unprocessable Entity) will be returned.

  OwnerReference contains enough information to let you identify an owning
  object. An owning object must be in the same namespace as the dependent, or
  be cluster-scoped, so there is no namespace field.
