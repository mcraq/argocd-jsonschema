      Operation is the type of operation which lead to this ManagedFieldsEntry being created.
      The only valid values for this field are 'Apply' and 'Update'.
  apiVersion:
    type:
      - string
      - "null"
    description: |-
      APIVersion defines the version of this resource that this field set
      applies to. The format is "group/version" just like the top-level
      APIVersion field. It is necessary to track the version of a field
      set because it cannot be automatically converted.

          Represents seconds of UTC time since Unix epoch

        description: |-
          Non-negative fractions of a second at nanosecond resolution. Negative
          second values with fractions must still have non-negative nanos values
          that count forward in time. Must be from 0 to 999,999,999
          inclusive. This field may be limited in precision depending on context.
    description: |-
      Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct
      marshaling to YAML and JSON.  Wrappers are provided for many
      of the factory methods that the time package offers.

      FieldsType is the discriminator for the different fields format and version.
      There is currently only one possible value: "FieldsV1"
  fieldsV1:
    type:
      - object
      - "null"
    properties:
      Raw:
        type:
          - string

        format: byte
        description: Raw is the underlying serialization of this object.
    description: |-
      FieldsV1 stores a set of fields in a data structure like a Trie, in JSON format.

      Each key is either a '.' representing the field itself, and will always map to an empty set,
      or a string representing a sub-field or item. The string will follow one of these four formats:
      'f:<name>', where <name> is the name of a field in a struct, or key in a map
      'v:<value>', where <value> is the exact json formatted value of a list item
      'i:<index>', where <index> is position of a item in a list
      'k:<keys>', where <keys> is a map of  a list item's key fields to their unique values
      If a key maps to an empty Fields value, the field that key represents is part of the set.

      The exact format is defined in sigs.k8s.io/structured-merge-diff

  subresource:
    type:
      - string
      - "null"
    description: |-
      Subresource is the name of the subresource used to update that object, or
      empty string if the object was updated through the main resource. The
      value of this field is used to distinguish between managers, even if they
      share the same name. For example, a status update will be distinct from a
      regular update using the same manager name.
      Note that the APIVersion field is not related to the Subresource field and
      it always corresponds to the version of the main resource.

  ManagedFieldsEntry is a workflow-id, a FieldSet and the group version of the resource
  that the fieldset applies to.
