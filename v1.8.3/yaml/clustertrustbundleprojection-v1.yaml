          matchLabels is a map of {key,value} pairs. A single {key,value} in the matchLabels
          map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is "key", the
          operator is "In", and the values array contains only "value". The requirements are ANDed.

                values is an array of string values. If the operator is In or NotIn,
                the values array must be non-empty. If the operator is Exists or DoesNotExist,
                the values array must be empty. This array is replaced during a strategic
                merge patch.

            A label selector requirement is a selector that contains values, a key, and an operator that
            relates the key and values.

          matchExpressions is a list of label selector requirements. The requirements are ANDed.

    title: |-
      A label selector is a label query over a set of resources. The result of matchLabels and
      matchExpressions are ANDed. An empty label selector matches all objects. A null
      label selector matches no objects.
