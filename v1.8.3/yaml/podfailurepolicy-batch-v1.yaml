            - FailJob: indicates that the pod's job is marked as Failed and all
              running pods are terminated.
            - FailIndex: indicates that the pod's index is marked as Failed and will
              not be restarted.
              This value is beta-level. It can be used when the
              `JobBackoffLimitPerIndex` feature gate is enabled (enabled by default).
            - Ignore: indicates that the counter towards the .backoffLimit is not
              incremented and a replacement pod is created.
            - Count: indicates that the pod is handled in the default way - the
              counter towards the .backoffLimit is incremented.
            Additional values are considered to be added in the future. Clients should
            react to an unknown action by skipping the rule.

                Restricts the check for exit codes to the container with the
                specified name. When null, the rule applies to all containers.
                When specified, it should match one the container or initContainer
                names in the pod template.

                - In: the requirement is satisfied if at least one container exit code
                  (might be multiple if there are multiple containers not restricted
                  by the 'containerName' field) is in the set of specified values.

                  (might be multiple if there are multiple containers not restricted
                  by the 'containerName' field) is not in the set of specified values.

                Represents the relationship between the container exit code(s) and the
                specified values. Containers completed with success (exit code 0) are

              title: |-
                Specifies the set of values. Each returned container exit code (might be
                multiple in case of multiple containers) is checked against this set of
                values with respect to the operator. The list of values must be ordered
                and must not contain duplicates. Value '0' cannot be used for the In operator.
                At least one element is required. At most 255 elements are allowed.

            PodFailurePolicyOnExitCodesRequirement describes the requirement for handling
            a failed pod based on its container exit codes. In particular, it lookups the
            .state.terminated.exitCode for each app container and init container status,
            represented by the .status.containerStatuses and .status.initContainerStatuses
            fields in the Pod status, respectively. Containers completed with success
            (exit code 0) are excluded from the requirement check.

              PodFailurePolicyOnPodConditionsPattern describes a pattern for matching
              an actual pod condition type.
          title: |-
            Represents the requirement on the pod conditions. The requirement is represented
            as a list of pod condition patterns. The requirement is satisfied if at
            least one pattern matches an actual pod condition. At most 20 elements are allowed.

        PodFailurePolicyRule describes how a pod failure is handled when the requirements are met.
        One of onExitCodes and onPodConditions, but not both, can be used in each rule.
    title: |-
      A list of pod failure policy rules. The rules are evaluated in order.
      Once a rule matches a Pod failure, the remaining of the rules are ignored.
      When no rule matches the Pod failure, the default handling applies - the
      counter of pod failures is incremented and it is checked against
      the backoffLimit. At most 20 elements are allowed.
      +listType=atomic
description: PodFailurePolicy describes how failed pods influence the backoffLimit.
