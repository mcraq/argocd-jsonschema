          ResourceClaimTemplateName is the name of a ResourceClaimTemplate
          object in the same namespace as this pod.

          The template will be used to create a new ResourceClaim, which will
          be bound to this pod. When this pod is deleted, the ResourceClaim
          will also be deleted. The pod name and resource name, along with a
          generated component, will be used to form a unique name for the
          ResourceClaim, which will be recorded in pod.status.resourceClaimStatuses.

          This field is immutable and no changes will be made to the
          corresponding ResourceClaim by the control plane after creating the
          ResourceClaim.

      ClaimSource describes a reference to a ResourceClaim.

      Exactly one of these fields should be set.  Consumers of this type must
      treat an empty object as if it has an unknown value.
description: |-
  PodResourceClaim references exactly one ResourceClaim through a ClaimSource.
  It adds a name to it that uniquely identifies the ResourceClaim inside the Pod.
  Containers that need access to the ResourceClaim reference it with this name.
